# 💊 Medicine Price Tracker For Affordable Healthcare

## 📌 Project Overview
Access to affordable healthcare is often limited by the rising costs of essential medicines.  
This project aims to scrape prices of essential medicines from multiple online pharmacies and provide a **dashboard** where people can **compare prices** and find the **most affordable sources**.  

By making medicine price data transparent and easily accessible, we hope to empower individuals to make cost-effective healthcare decisions.
